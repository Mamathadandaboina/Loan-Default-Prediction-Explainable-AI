## Loan Default Prediction with Explainable AI (SHAP and LIME)

### Overview

This project focuses on predicting loan default using Logistic Regression while applying Explainable AI methods like SHAP and LIME to make the model’s decisions transparent and easy to understand. It’s designed to support fair and data-driven decision-making in credit risk analysis.

### Key Highlights

* Built a Logistic Regression model to classify borrowers as “Default” or “Good Credit.”
* Used **SHAP** to understand which features influence predictions globally.
* Used **LIME** to explain individual borrower predictions in a simple, interpretable way.
* Evaluated the model with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

### Tools and Technologies

Python | Google Colab | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Scikit-learn | SHAP | LIME

### Results

* **Model Accuracy:** 71.8%
* **Top Features:** Income, Interest Rate, Loan Amount, Age, and Credit History Length
* SHAP and LIME provided consistent, explainable insights into model behavior.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Explainable AI can make financial models more transparent and trustworthy. By combining predictive modeling with SHAP and LIME, we can better understand *why* a model predicts loan default, not just *what* it predicts.
